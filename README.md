# Epidemic_Detection_Study

Specific Aims:  

We propose using IRIS nation-wide clinical data to apply our established NIH grant-funded methods to: test epidemic detection models, investigate seasonal epidemiology, and assess the complementary utility of combining clinical and internet-based data analysis to better detect US infectious eye epidemics. We have used internet search data, social media posts, and UCSF clinical data to define clinical age-specific seasonal conjunctivitis patterns unique to age, subtype and clinical specialty in the US. Social media posts broadly track the seasonal occurrence of allergic and infectious conjunctivitis, and may be useful in monitoring. Replication and extension based on the larger IRIS data would be valuable. Using internet-based datasets we also identified large conjunctivitis epidemics worldwide, with a sensitivity (comparing to available reports) of about 60-85%. Validation based on US IRIS clinical data is essential if such methods are to be used in practice.

•	Aim 1: Define seasonal patterns of infectious, allergic, other conjunctivitis, corneal ulcer, and control eye disease, by region and demographic. Hypothesis: clinical seasonal eye condition patterns will be identified in the IRIS, but patterns will differ based on disease and location. 

•	Aim 2: Hypothesis: clinical infectious eye disease epidemics will be detected, but more frequently for smaller geographic regions than larger ones and for conjunctivitis than for corneal ulcer.

•	Aim 3: Cross-validation of findings from Aims 1 and 2 using a hidden state model. Hypothesis: (a) some clinical infectious eye disease seasonal patterns and clinical candidate epidemics identified from national IRIS health datasets will be validated by analyses of online search and social media, (b) clinical or regional subgroup-specific results from IRIS data analysis are more likely to be validated from results of analysis of online data for the same clinical or regional sub-groups than for different ones.

Significance: Successful completion of the project aims can improve US tracking, identification, modeling, and prediction of ocular disease epidemics in the US. Corneal ulcer is often a preventable cause of blindness, and even conjunctivitis has a significant impact on the US economy. This project will provide unique data for the epidemiology of conjunctivitis, including frequency of epidemics, estimation of latency period, and transmission between regions.  

Study Date Range (data available from 1/1/2013-12/31/2018):  We'd prefer as long of a span as possible, dependent upon the availability and quality of earlier data, in order to increase the odds of detecting epidemics and more accurate depiction of seasonality: 01/01/2013-12/31/2018.  

Study Population Age Range:  All ages (we are aware the majority of IRIS population will not be children)

Inclusion Criteria/Index Event: (include all ICD 9 and ICD 10 and CPT codes that are relevant): listed in code
